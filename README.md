In the realm of software development, C and C++ are widely used programming languages, particularly in systems where performance and resource management are critical. However, code vulnerabilities in these languages can lead to severe security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection, such as manual code reviews and static analysis tools, often fall short due to the complexity and volume of code.
Objective:
This study aims to explore the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting vulnerabilities in C/C++ code. Specifically, we compare the performance of three models:
Random Forest & XGBoost & Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
By evaluating these models on a standardized dataset, we seek to determine which approach offers the best accuracy and reliability for vulnerability detection.

There are three ipynb respecting to three models, including data preprocessing, Model Architectures and everything.

And the dataset of these three model used is from https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_vulnerability_CSV_Dataset
